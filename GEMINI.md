# Gemini's Best Practices for this Rust Project

This document outlines best practices and recommendations for the future development of this Rust project. Applying these suggestions will help improve the codebase's robustness, maintainability, and overall quality.

## 1. Error Handling

The current implementation uses `String` for error handling in many places. While this is simple, it's not very robust. A better approach is to use custom error types.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Use Custom Error Types:** Define custom error enums for different parts of the application (e.g., `ConfigError`, `ScheduleError`). This allows for more granular error handling and makes the code easier to debug. The [`thiserror`](https://crates.io/crates/thiserror) crate is excellent for this.

**Example:**

```rust
use thiserror::Error;
use std::path::PathBuf;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum ConfigError {
    #[error("Invalid config file path: {0}")]
    InvalidPath(PathBuf),
    #[error("Failed to read config file: {0}")]
    ReadFile(#[from] std::io::Error),
    #[error("Failed to parse config file: {0}")]
    Parse(#[from] serde_yaml::Error),
}

pub fn parse(config_file: PathBuf) -> Result<Config, ConfigError> {
    let content = std::fs::read_to_string(&config_file)?;
    let config = serde_yaml::from_str(&content)?;
    Ok(config)
}
```

## 2. Modularity and Code Organization

The project is already well-organized into modules. Here are a few suggestions to improve it further.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Use `pub(crate)` consistently:** The use of `pub(crate)` is good for internal visibility. Continue to use it to expose only the necessary parts of each module.
*   **Create a `lib.rs`:** For larger applications, it's a good practice to move the library-like parts of the code into `src/lib.rs` and have a very small `src/main.rs` that calls into the library. This improves code reuse and testing.

## 3. Configuration Management

The current configuration is handled in `config.rs`. The parsing logic is good, but it could be more robust.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Configuration Validation:** Add validation logic to the `Config` struct to ensure that the configuration is valid before it's used. For example, check that the `to` date is after the `from` date.
*   **Use `Path` instead of `PathBuf` for arguments:** In `config::parse`, it's more idiomatic to accept `&Path` instead of `PathBuf` as an argument. This is more flexible as it allows any path-like object to be passed in.

## 4. Testing

There are no tests in the project. Adding tests is crucial for ensuring the correctness of the scheduling algorithms and preventing regressions.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Add Unit Tests:** Create a `tests` module in each file (e.g., `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }`) to test individual functions.
*   **Add Integration Tests:** Create a `tests` directory at the root of the project (i.e., `/tests/...`) to write integration tests that test the entire application's workflow.
*   **Use `cargo test`:** Run tests regularly using `cargo test`.

**Example (in `src/algo/roundrobin.rs`):**

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use chrono::NaiveDate;
    use std::collections::HashSet;

    #[test]
    fn test_simple_schedule() {
        let people = vec![
            Person { name: "Alice".to_string(), ooo: HashSet::new() },
            Person { name: "Bob".to_string(), ooo: HashSet::new() },
        ];
        let start = NaiveDate::from_ymd(2025, 1, 1);
        let end = NaiveDate::from_ymd(2025, 1, 5);
        let schedule = schedule(people, start, end, 2).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(schedule.turns.len(), 3);
        assert_eq!(schedule.turns[0].person, 0); // Alice
        assert_eq!(schedule.turns[1].person, 1); // Bob
        assert_eq!(schedule.turns[2].person, 0); // Alice
    }
}
```

## 5. Dependency Management

The project uses `Cargo.toml` for dependency management, which is standard.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Use `cargo-edit`:** The [`cargo-edit`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-edit) crate provides the `cargo add` command, which makes it easy to add and manage dependencies.
*   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly run `cargo update` to keep dependencies up to date and benefit from bug fixes and performance improvements.

## 6. Code Style and Formatting

The code is already well-formatted. Using `rustfmt` will ensure consistency.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Use `rustfmt`:** Run `cargo fmt` to automatically format the code according to the standard Rust style.
*   **Use `clippy`:** Run `cargo clippy` to catch common mistakes and improve the code's quality. Clippy provides a lot of useful lints.

## 7. Documentation

The code has some comments, but it could be improved with more comprehensive documentation.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Add Doc Comments:** Add `///` comments to public functions, structs, and enums to explain what they do. This documentation can be used to generate HTML documentation with `cargo doc`.
*   **Explain the "Why":** In comments, focus on explaining *why* the code is written the way it is, rather than just *what* it does. This is more valuable for future developers.
